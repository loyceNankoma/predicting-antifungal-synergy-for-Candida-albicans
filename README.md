This repository contains all code and resources used in the study “Predicting Synergistic Antifungal Combinations Against Candida albicans Using Machine Learning.”
The project applies multiple supervised learning models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and SVM to predict synergistic antifungal drug pairs from chemogenomic and molecular descriptor datasets.
